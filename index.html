            Hi I'm Nathaniel Jansen from Westminster CO. I am just now starting this exciting journey into web deveopement. While I've
            of done some(I mean a little) html and css in in the past, I am now diving in all the way.
        </p>
        <p>For more than 10 years I worked in the automotive industry providing dealers with online marketing of their vehicles.
            We would provide phtographs and data entry, along with window stickers and Buyers Guides in order to help customers
            make an informed decision. While I grew through the ranks of the corporate ladder, I always had it in the back
            of my mind that I would like to achieve more, make something more and become something more.
        </p>

        <p>I've made some changes in employment in the last year. This has allowed me to take on this new and exciting challenge.
            Currently I work for and engineering company building drift cars and once again I'm seeing tools that could be
            improved upon. I'm hoping this bootcamp will allow me the opportunity to learn how these systems work, what I
            can do to make them better, and build a life long career that isn't so focused on one individual industry.
        </p>

        <p>I look forward to constantly growing and achieving more.</p>
